In computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled as mergesort) is an efficient, general-purpose, and **comparison-based** sorting algorithm. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945

```java
public static int[] fusion(int[] arr1, int[] arr2): 
	return sorted(arr1+arr2);
```
